==========================

The |hisparc| Weather software is included in the HiSPARC installer.
Which can be downloaded here: `HiSPARC Installer
<http://www.hisparc.nl/downloads/software/>`_. A pdf version of this
manual is available here: `Weather DAQ Documentation <weather.pdf>`_

For questions or suggestions please contact our project coordinator

The |hisparc| Weather DAQ is the software which controls a weather
station. The software reads out the sensors and then displays the
measurements on the screen. It also sends the results to the |hisparc|
buffer database. The |hisparc| project uses weather stations to measure
weather conditions in locations where cosmic-ray air showers are also
being detected to allow for more accurate reconstruction.
