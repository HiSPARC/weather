Overview
========

From version 2 onwards, full software control is provided for setting
weather station parameters, sensor calibration and data taking
conditions. Depending on the hardware configuration various sensors are
read at a regular time intervals; every 5 seconds, the data acquisition
software asks the weather station console to transfer its latest
measurements. These values are presented on the first tab page. The
second tab page displays data collected over past hour at the basis of 1
minute averages. Tab page 3 displays data collected over past 48 hours
(based on 10 minute averages). Status and error messages are presented
on tab page 4.

Before submitting data to the central HiSPARC database, tab page 5
requires careful examination. It is here that the running conditions are
defined which may depend on weather station model type (only a limited
number of Davis weather stations are supported, please contact the
HiSPARC team for further information), hardware configuration and/or
console firmware version.
