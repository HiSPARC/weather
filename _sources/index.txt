The |hisparc| Weather DAQ is the software which controls a weather station. The software reads out the sensors and then displays the measurements on the screen. It also sends the results to the |hisparc| buffer database. The |hisparc| project uses weather stations to measure weather conditions in locations where cosmic-ray air showers are also being detected to allow for more accurate reconstruction.
